\section{Conclusion}
FGSM and critical point drop prove that LiDAR-based detection model are vulnerable to adversarial attack. FGSM defense confirms that adversarial training of LiDAR-based detection model can defense adversarial attack. Points perturbation and points drop datasets provide a benchmark dataset to benchmark robustness of LiDAR-based detection models. Adverse weather points simulation improves robustness by using additional data in adverse weather.

\section{Future Work}
In simulation of adverse weather point cloud, we could use more realistic simulation by adding perturbation of clusters and ground points.
